        What Makes RB8 Faster - Flexi Front Wing
Posted on November 21, 2012 by Franky_AFC

I've mentioned in a previous post on McLaren Spa Updates that McLaren is possibly using Flexi front wing. 
The flexi part is not new to F1 cars, Red Bull used it back in 2010, other teams tried on this principle as well although not all of them achieved preferable results.


Basically, at moderate speed, the front wing runs at a relatively high angle of attack, maximizing downforce generated. At high speeds (long straights), the outer part of the wing tilts pack, reducing AoA, therefore reducing both downforce and drag (Although Research on Honda 2007 shows that there is scarce decrease in drag, although downforce deduction is noticeable). The shedding of downforce promotes better aero balance of the car - as what Mercedes want to achieve with their FW DDRS system. Flexi front wing also helps guiding the air around the wheel inward underneath the car, subsequently enhancing diffuser performance.

While Adrian Newey highlighted the loss of downforce due to ban of EBD as their major problem this year, the Flexi front wing should be one of the compensation they found.

In this December's Racecar Engineering there is an interesting article regarding the composites used for flexi front wing. Basically, teams are using FEA (Finite Element Analysis) to evaluate material deformation under loading - they're seeking for an optimised aerodynamics design that could meet all the FIA crash test requirements.

As illustrated in the picture above, flexi wing can have less bending deformation and more twisting/tilting at the rear of the wing.

What about RB8 Flexi Front Wing?

RB8's new front package is actually quite unique - in additioin to the wing flexing, they seem to have a rubber nose that can deform/tilt under loading. This pitstop from Vettle in Abu Dhabi caused lots of discussion as the mechanicseem to flex the nose when removing it.


However Vettle's front wing was slightly damaged at that point, which may exagerate the nose tilting observed. Another GIF from Webber during the race does show quite large oscillation of the front wing as it goes through kerbs.

Generally speaking, RB8 now has a really flexible front package - the tip of nosecone can bend downwards, also the outer section of front wing tilts back at high-speed.

Besides the benefit of downforce reduction and airflow enhancement around/underneath the car, Red Bull's rubber nosecone may also create a mass damper effect, whereby car bounce is deducted, enhancing chasis stability.

The mass damper effect is well demonstrated in the video below, as can be seen, with a mass damper extended out, bumping on the main structure is significantly reduced.



The mass damper idea is not new to F1 - used by Renault back in 2005, although it's later banned by FIA in 2007 (More to read if you're interested in mass damper effect: J-dampers in Formula One). However, Red Bull's Flexi front wing is an innovative idea extending this principal. The improvement of chasis stability also supports more stable aerodynamic performance for RB8.

            <p id="story_continues_2">    Alonso made the win from laps 16 to 30, when he pulled away from everyone else on the intermediate tyres after the safety car had pulled off to restart the race. 
</p>
	    
          <p>    His pace in those laps was quite phenomenal. 
</p>
  
          <p>    The Ferrari is not a good car, as everyone in F1 knows, but the damp conditions meant its weaknesses were not as exposed as they are in the dry because the forces through the car are not as great. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It backs up my theory that there is a problem with the front end of the Ferrari, that it cannot cope with lateral forces in corners because the front-tyre contact patch is moving around. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Sergio Perez also did a fantastic job in the Sauber to finish second. 
</p>
  
          <p>    He was on good form throughout the race and just lost out on winning when he made a 
    
little mistake and caught the car on the kerbs.

</p>
  
          <p>    There will be a lot of conspiracy theories about what happened, given that Ferrari supply Sauber&#039;s engines. 
</p>
  
          <p>    But Perez could easily have cruised around behind Alonso if he had wanted to just hang on to second place, so I think it was a genuine mistake. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Even after that, Perez was still pushing on, which is the best thing a driver can do, because it is very easy to lose concentration and make a mistake if you try to back off and cruise to the finish. 
</p>
  
          <p>    We have always known Perez is good - but on Sunday he proved he is potentially a star of the future. 
</p>
  
          <p>    McLaren just seemed to drop away after another really strong performance in qualifying. 
</p>
                                    
                                        <img class="holding" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/59290000/jpg/_59290153_mmf1perezbadlapv1.jpg" width="448" height="252" alt="Sergio Perez runs wide" />
                        
            </div>
    	
    		
  
          <p>    Lewis Hamilton just did not seem to have the pace, which is unusual for him in wet conditions, while, after one very fast lap after fitting intermediate tyres, Jenson Button lost tyre temperature and struggled. 
</p>
  
          <p>    McLaren run their car very stiff, so it responds to high-grip situations and loads the tyres very well in dry conditions, but when it is low grip it struggles. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Red Bull are back in the pack after two seasons with a dominant car.  
</p>
  
          <p>    Mark Webber produced a few fast laps at various points in the race, so the car clearly has good downforce levels, but by no means have they got anywhere near the relative performance they are used to. 
</p>
  
          <p>    That is going to be a bit worrying for them because it is tough to play catch-up.  You are trying to get your car to your rivals&#039; level and overtake them, so you have to develop at a faster pace than the teams in front of you. 
</p>
  
          <p>    There will be a little bit of head-scratching at Red Bull as to why they have found themselves in that situation. 
</p>
  
          <p>    In practice in Malaysia, chief technical officer Adrian Newey was paying close attention to the car, looking at a little gap that was between two parts of the front wing. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It was only a millimetre or so. It would lose a little bit of efficiency, but it is very difficult to get an absolutely perfect fit between two sliding surfaces. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It shows you how pernickety it can be finding performance in an F1 car - and Newey&#039;s attention to detail. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It is the first time for more than two years that Red Bull have to get themselves out of a bit of a hole and it is going to be interesting to see their reaction. 
</p>
  
    <h2 class="cross-head">TECHNICAL </h2>
	
          <p>    <strong>    Ferrari
</strong>
     introduced a new front wing in Malaysia, which Alonso tested in Friday practice before it was fitted to both cars for Saturday and Sunday. 
</p>
  
    <div class="story-feature image">
  <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/59292000/jpg/_59292981_59292980.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="Ferrari front wing" />

  </div>

          <p>    It has more slot gaps in it, creating five sections rather than four on the outside parts of the wing. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Ferrari have been struggling with a lack of front-end grip in fast corners and this wing is an attempt to find more consistent front downforce and prevent the wing from &#039;stalling&#039; as much. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Personally, I think the front-wing endplates are as much of a problem as anything for Ferrari. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Teams use these to deflect as much air as possible from the front wing outside the front tyres, and Ferrari&#039;s endplates are not anywhere near as aggressive as those of most other teams. 
</p>
  
          <p>    That means they are getting a bigger percentage of air going inside the front tyres, which is disturbing the crucial airflow under the car. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It suggests something is wrong with their modelling, and that they are not getting the right results from it. 
</p>
  
          <p>    The word in the paddock is that Ferrari are developing what will effectively be a new car for the Spanish Grand Prix in May - albeit built around the same chassis as the current one.  
</p>
  
          <p>    There is talk of new rear aerodynamics, a new exhaust position, and possibly replacing the unique pull-rod suspension with more conventional push-rod. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It remains to be seen just how different it actually is.
</p>
  
          <p>    <strong>    Red Bull
</strong>
     played around with angle of their exhaust exits on their rear bodywork - in Malaysia they were directed further away from the centre of the car than they had been in Australia. 
</p>
  
    <div class="story-feature image">

  </div>

          <p>    They are trying to get the exhaust down to the outside of the floor, to help it seal the area around the rear tyres, which is what blown diffusers did last year. 
</p>
  
          <p>    But it is a difficult thing to model, and it is likely they will only know its effectiveness once it is on the car - by measuring the temperature of various parts of the floor.

          <p>    That is going to be a bit worrying for them because it is tough to play catch-up.  You are trying to get your car to your rivals&#039; level and overtake them, so you have to develop at a faster pace than the teams in front of you.

          <p>    It shows you how pernickety it can be finding performance in an F1 car - and Newey&#039;s attention to detail.

          <p>    It is the first time for more than two years that Red Bull have to get themselves out of a bit of a hole and it is going to be interesting to see their reaction.

          <p>    <strong>    Ferrari
</strong>
     introduced a new front wing in Malaysia, which Alonso tested in Friday practice before it was fitted to both cars for Saturday and Sunday. 
</p>
  
    <div class="story-feature image">
  <img src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/59292000/jpg/_59292981_59292980.jpg" width="320" height="180" alt="Ferrari front wing" />

  </div>

          <p>    It has more slot gaps in it, creating five sections rather than four on the outside parts of the wing. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Ferrari have been struggling with a lack of front-end grip in fast corners and this wing is an attempt to find more consistent front downforce and prevent the wing from &#039;stalling&#039; as much. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Personally, I think the front-wing endplates are as much of a problem as anything for Ferrari. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Teams use these to deflect as much air as possible from the front wing outside the front tyres, and Ferrari&#039;s endplates are not anywhere near as aggressive as those of most other teams. 
</p>
  
          <p>    That means they are getting a bigger percentage of air going inside the front tyres, which is disturbing the crucial airflow under the car. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It suggests something is wrong with their modelling, and that they are not getting the right results from it. 
</p>
  
          <p>    The word in the paddock is that Ferrari are developing what will effectively be a new car for the Spanish Grand Prix in May - albeit built around the same chassis as the current one.  
</p>
  
          <p>    There is talk of new rear aerodynamics, a new exhaust position, and possibly replacing the unique pull-rod suspension with more conventional push-rod. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It remains to be seen just how different it actually is.
</p>
  
          <p>    <strong>    Red Bull
</strong>
     played around with angle of their exhaust exits on their rear bodywork - in Malaysia they were directed further away from the centre of the car than they had been in Australia. 
</p>

  </div>

          <p>    They are trying to get the exhaust down to the outside of the floor, to help it seal the area around the rear tyres, which is what blown diffusers did last year. 
</p>
  
          <p>    But it is a difficult thing to model, and it is likely they will only know its effectiveness once it is on the car - by measuring the temperature of various parts of the floor.

</p>
  
          <p>    The Ferrari is not a good car, as everyone in F1 knows, but the damp conditions meant its weaknesses were not as exposed as they are in the dry because the forces through the car are not as great. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It backs up my theory that there is a problem with the front end of the Ferrari, that it cannot cope with lateral forces in corners because the front-tyre contact patch is moving around. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Sergio Perez also did a fantastic job in the Sauber to finish second.

          <p>    <strong>    Ferrari
</strong>
     introduced a new front wing in Malaysia, which Alonso tested in Friday practice before it was fitted to both cars for Saturday and Sunday.

  </div>

          <p>    It has more slot gaps in it, creating five sections rather than four on the outside parts of the wing. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Ferrari have been struggling with a lack of front-end grip in fast corners and this wing is an attempt to find more consistent front downforce and prevent the wing from &#039;stalling&#039; as much. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Personally, I think the front-wing endplates are as much of a problem as anything for Ferrari. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Teams use these to deflect as much air as possible from the front wing outside the front tyres, and Ferrari&#039;s endplates are not anywhere near as aggressive as those of most other teams. 
</p>
  
          <p>    That means they are getting a bigger percentage of air going inside the front tyres, which is disturbing the crucial airflow under the car. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It suggests something is wrong with their modelling, and that they are not getting the right results from it. 
</p>
  
          <p>    The word in the paddock is that Ferrari are developing what will effectively be a new car for the Spanish Grand Prix in May - albeit built around the same chassis as the current one.  
</p>
  
          <p>    There is talk of new rear aerodynamics, a new exhaust position, and possibly replacing the unique pull-rod suspension with more conventional push-rod. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It remains to be seen just how different it actually is.
</p>

</strong>
     played around with angle of their exhaust exits on their rear bodywork - in Malaysia they were directed further away from the centre of the car than they had been in Australia.

  </div>

          <p>    They are trying to get the exhaust down to the outside of the floor, to help it seal the area around the rear tyres, which is what blown diffusers did last year. 
</p>
  
          <p>    But it is a difficult thing to model, and it is likely they will only know its effectiveness once it is on the car - by measuring the temperature of various parts of the floor.

            <p class="introduction" id="story_continues_1">    Fernando Alonso did a great job to win the Malaysian Grand Prix for Ferrari. He was quick in all conditions, in the wet and in the dry. 
	    </p>
  
            <p>    It was a fantastic drive - and it just shows the level of Alonso&#039;s talent.

            <p id="story_continues_2">    Alonso made the win from laps 16 to 30, when he pulled away from everyone else on the intermediate tyres after the safety car had pulled off to restart the race. 
</p>
	    
          <p>    His pace in those laps was quite phenomenal. 
</p>
  
          <p>    The Ferrari is not a good car, as everyone in F1 knows, but the damp conditions meant its weaknesses were not as exposed as they are in the dry because the forces through the car are not as great. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It backs up my theory that there is a problem with the front end of the Ferrari, that it cannot cope with lateral forces in corners because the front-tyre contact patch is moving around. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Sergio Perez also did a fantastic job in the Sauber to finish second. 
</p>
  
          <p>    He was on good form throughout the race and just lost out on winning when he made a 
    
little mistake and caught the car on the kerbs.

</p>
  
          <p>    There will be a lot of conspiracy theories about what happened, given that Ferrari supply Sauber&#039;s engines. 
</p>
  
          <p>    But Perez could easily have cruised around behind Alonso if he had wanted to just hang on to second place, so I think it was a genuine mistake. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Even after that, Perez was still pushing on, which is the best thing a driver can do, because it is very easy to lose concentration and make a mistake if you try to back off and cruise to the finish. 
</p>
  
          <p>    We have always known Perez is good - but on Sunday he proved he is potentially a star of the future. 
</p>
  
          <p>    McLaren just seemed to drop away after another really strong performance in qualifying. 
</p>
                                    
                                        <img class="holding" src="http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/59290000/jpg/_59290153_mmf1perezbadlapv1.jpg" width="448" height="252" alt="Sergio Perez runs wide" />
                        
            </div>
    	
    		
  
          <p>    Lewis Hamilton just did not seem to have the pace, which is unusual for him in wet conditions, while, after one very fast lap after fitting intermediate tyres, Jenson Button lost tyre temperature and struggled. 
</p>
  
          <p>    McLaren run their car very stiff, so it responds to high-grip situations and loads the tyres very well in dry conditions, but when it is low grip it struggles. 
</p>
  
          <p>    Red Bull are back in the pack after two seasons with a dominant car.  
</p>
  
          <p>    Mark Webber produced a few fast laps at various points in the race, so the car clearly has good downforce levels, but by no means have they got anywhere near the relative performance they are used to. 
</p>
  
          <p>    That is going to be a bit worrying for them because it is tough to play catch-up.  You are trying to get your car to your rivals&#039; level and overtake them, so you have to develop at a faster pace than the teams in front of you. 
</p>
  
          <p>    There will be a little bit of head-scratching at Red Bull as to why they have found themselves in that situation. 
</p>
  
          <p>    In practice in Malaysia, chief technical officer Adrian Newey was paying close attention to the car, looking at a little gap that was between two parts of the front wing. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It was only a millimetre or so. It would lose a little bit of efficiency, but it is very difficult to get an absolutely perfect fit between two sliding surfaces. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It shows you how pernickety it can be finding performance in an F1 car - and Newey&#039;s attention to detail. 
</p>
  
          <p>    It is the first time for more than two years that Red Bull have to get themselves out of a bit of a hole and it is going to be interesting to see their reaction.
